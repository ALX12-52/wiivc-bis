# WiiVC Banner/Icon/Sound (BIS)

This project started as a small request and template sharing thread over gbatemp, it eventually grow into a big project which goal is set a standart for Wii U injection, now it adds practically all injectable console templates.   

## Banner/icon creation guidelines:
* The template is pretty self-explanatory, you will need SCE-PS3 Rodin Latin Bold font, for japanese titles use Kozuka Gothic Pr6N font.
* Title screens resizing should use bicubic interpolation.

* A collection of WiiWare banners (.bnr)
* A collection of injected VC banners (GCN, NDS, N64, etc.)
